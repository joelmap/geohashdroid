Oh, hey.  You might've heard Google Code's shutting down.

So with that, this project's moved out to GitHub.  You can get it at https://github.com/CaptainSpam/geohashdroid.  Over there, you can see me finally getting around to the tablet update very very slowly, as well as witness the inevitable disaster of the whole project converting to Android Studio.

Enjoy!
